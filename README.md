# ID3-tree-builder-Java [14.10.2021]

This algorithm allows you to build decision tree from .csv datasets. \
The core is written by me in Java and then showed by JavaFX library. \
I'll be glad if you know how to make this thing a bit better and will help me!

*For russian localization you have to change String lang in HelloApplication to "ru_RU"*

Main window:

Settings window( allows you to manage the colors of the system and so aditional data):

To build a tree you have to use .csv files with the same structure:

Then you can simply show the decision tree by clicking the Build Tree:

TODO:
- there are some issues with list of attributes to recalculate gain
- dynamic language changing in settings window
- testing algorithm on other datasets ???
